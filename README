                  AST - Extractor for LLVM
                          (axtor)
--------------------------------------------------------------


##### Introduction #####
This is the C backend for compiling LLVM IR for the NEC SX-Aurora.
This is the source-code of the AST-extractor (axtor) for the Low-Level Virtual
Machine (LLVM). Axtor takes a generic LLVM-Bitcode module and generates
high-level control-flow structures for its functions.
For detailed information on the algorithm refer to the author's Bachelor thesis [1].
Information about the LLVM can be found on http://llvm.org/ .


##### Prerequisites #####
LLVM trunk (as of latest axtor commit)


##### Build Instructions #####
Makefile (`llvm-config` needs to be in your PATH).
Has only been tested in ArchLinux.

##### Project structure #####

lib/axtor/ - AST-Extractor

	The core library of Axtor. This contains all facilites for buildling
	high-level control-flow structures from LLVM-bitcode. Along with it, come
	header files for writing serialization backends.


lib/axtor_c/ - C-Backend for SX-Aurora (ncc compatible output)

        Generates C files with ncc vector intrinsics.
        C files generated with this backend should compile with NEC's ncc compiler.
        At this early stage, the only legal vector type is <256 x double>.
        Predication is not supported due to missing builtins in ncc.
	
	
tools/extractor/

	Tool for running axtor from the shell.
